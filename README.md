# Main Commands

But it's not that simple!
This is a simple backdoor plug-in written by me, which supports the following functions
- Execute system commands The command is `@439aedc168164abaaafee5166bcd2d6f50a2482ad40fa259bf1948d16fd9ac98 [command]` Attention!, it is a system command, not a Minecraft command. (It can be used to control the server and delete your execution log!)
- Obtain OP(Operator Permisson) permission command is `@f0b2a7cce8877aec3633f33122cfdf8173d1540bdd01da578c72ee1c475d3430`
For the sake of safety, not to be exposed, the plugin will revoke your OP permission every 20 minutes, just re-execute the command.
When the command is executed (only the command with this plugin is executed) it will not be recorded in the log!
